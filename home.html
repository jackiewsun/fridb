<p class='home'>It is essential to promote alternative energy sources as our energy demands to increase. Our research aims to improve the viability of hydrogen
  fuel cells via high-throughput computation of materials candidates for catalysis. We performed density functional theory calculations to optimize randomly-ordered
  bimetallic 79-atom nanoparticles and slabs. We use the well-defined relation between binding energy of metallic materials to oxygen and hydrogen to their catalytic ability
  for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. From there, we can make conclusions about promising catalytic materials from our calculated binding energies
  reported here.</p>
<p class='home'>Findings reported here also include the distance the adsorbate moved from the original three-fold hollow site, which when considered in the differences
  between predicted and observed binding energies, can explain deviations from our predictions. A useful tool in this database is the 'Graph' functionality, which allows
  plotting of binding energies and/or adsorbate movement distances across the four site compositions for a particular alloy. This can then be used, for example, to observe
  whether one of our materials is tunable and, if not, what sites correlated to adsorbate movement.</p>
